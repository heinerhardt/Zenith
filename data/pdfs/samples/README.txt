Sample PDF Directory
====================

Place your PDF files in this directory or its subdirectories.

The system will automatically discover and process all PDF files
when you select this directory in the application.

For testing, you can:
1. Add any PDF documents you want to chat with
2. Use the web interface to upload files directly
3. Specify this directory path in the application

Example structure:
- data/pdfs/samples/document1.pdf
- data/pdfs/samples/research/paper1.pdf
- data/pdfs/samples/manuals/manual1.pdf
