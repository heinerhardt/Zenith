# Fix Critical Database Security Vulnerabilities

## Problem/Goal
Address critical security vulnerabilities identified in the Database configuration page code review:

1. **Path Traversal Vulnerability**: User-controlled database path allows arbitrary file system access
2. **Directory Creation Risk**: Automatic directory creation without path validation
3. **SQL Injection Risk**: Direct SQL execution with user-controlled database paths
4. **Resource Leaks**: SQLite connections not properly managed with context managers
5. **Race Conditions**: Settings updates bypassing thread-safe enhanced settings manager

These vulnerabilities could allow admin users to access/modify arbitrary files, create directories anywhere on the filesystem, and potentially cause resource exhaustion.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Implement robust database path validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add directory creation security with project root boundary enforcement  
- [ ] Replace direct SQL connections with proper context managers
- [ ] Ensure all database operations use parameterized queries
- [ ] Fix settings updates to use enhanced settings manager thread safety
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation for all admin database configuration fields
- [ ] Update error handling to prevent information disclosure
- [ ] Add security unit tests for path validation and database operations

## Context Manifest

### How the Database Configuration Page Currently Works

The Database Configuration page in `simple_chat_app.py` (lines 1407-1726) provides admin users with direct control over critical system database settings. This page exposes SQLite configuration through Streamlit UI components and performs several dangerous operations:

**Path Input Flow (Lines 1507-1511):**
When an admin accesses the Database Settings page, they encounter a text input field for "Database File Path" that accepts arbitrary user input without any validation. The current implementation simply takes whatever path the user provides:
```python
database_path = st.text_input(
    "Database File Path",
    value=getattr(current_settings, 'sqlite_db_path', './data/zenith.db'),
    help="Path to SQLite database file for system data"
)
```

This path is then used directly in multiple critical operations without any security checks. The system assumes the admin user is trustworthy, but this creates a significant attack surface since admin credentials could be compromised.

**Directory Creation Security Risk (Lines 1556-1568):**
When users click the "Test SQLite" button, the system automatically creates directories without validation:
```python
# Ensure directory exists
db_dir = os.path.dirname(database_path)
if db_dir and not os.path.exists(db_dir):
    os.makedirs(db_dir, exist_ok=True)
```

This allows an attacker to create directories anywhere on the filesystem that the application has write access to. For example, providing a path like `../../../etc/malicious.db` could create directories outside the project scope. The `os.makedirs()` call with `exist_ok=True` will create the entire directory tree without question.

**Direct SQL Connection Management (Lines 1561-1585):**
The application opens SQLite connections without proper context management:
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect(database_path)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT sqlite_version()")
version = cursor.fetchone()[0]
conn.close()
```

This pattern is repeated multiple times and has several problems: First, it connects to arbitrary user-controlled database paths, which could be used to access existing database files elsewhere on the system. Second, if exceptions occur between `connect()` and `close()`, the connection may leak. Third, there's no timeout or connection limiting, allowing potential resource exhaustion attacks.

**Settings Update Bypass (Lines 1686-1726):**
The most critical security flaw is that database settings updates bypass the thread-safe enhanced settings manager entirely:
```python
success, message = settings_manager.update_settings(updates)
```

While this appears to use the settings manager, the problem is that the user-controlled `database_path` is passed through without validation first. The enhanced settings manager (which has proper thread locking via `self._lock = threading.Lock()` in lines 35-36) assumes the data it receives has already been validated and sanitized.

### Enhanced Settings Manager Thread Safety Architecture

The `enhanced_settings_manager.py` provides a robust, thread-safe framework for settings updates that the database configuration page should be using correctly:

**Thread Locking Pattern:**
The enhanced settings manager uses a threading lock to ensure atomicity of settings operations:
```python
def update_settings(self, updates: Dict[str, Any]) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    with self._lock:
        try:
            # Validate updates
            validation_error = self._validate_settings_update(updates)
            if validation_error:
                return False, validation_error
            # ... rest of atomic update process
```

This ensures that concurrent settings updates don't interfere with each other, which is critical in a multi-user web application. However, the current database page implementation doesn't leverage this pattern correctly because it passes unvalidated, potentially malicious paths into this system.

**Settings Validation Framework:**
The enhanced settings manager includes a `_validate_settings_update()` method (lines 765-812) that validates various setting types, but it lacks specific path validation:
```python
def _validate_settings_update(self, updates: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[str]:
    # Validates numeric values, boolean fields, provider types
    # BUT MISSING: Path validation for database paths
```

The validation framework exists but needs to be extended with secure path validation functions.

### Security Patterns Used Elsewhere in the Codebase

**Authentication Security Model:**
The codebase demonstrates strong security practices in the authentication system (`src/auth/auth_manager.py`, `src/utils/security.py`):

- **Password Hashing:** Uses bcrypt with salt generation: `bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)`
- **JWT Token Security:** Implements proper token expiration and verification with HMAC SHA-256
- **Input Sanitization:** The `sanitize_text()` function in `helpers.py` (lines 289-313) removes control characters and normalizes whitespace
- **Secure Filename Handling:** The `safe_filename()` function (lines 112-136) strips dangerous characters from filenames

**File Handling Security Patterns:**
The PDF processor and helpers demonstrate secure file handling:

- **File Type Validation:** `validate_file_type()` in `helpers.py` checks file extensions
- **Temporary File Management:** `create_temp_file()` uses Python's `tempfile` module with proper cleanup
- **Path Normalization:** Uses `Path()` objects from `pathlib` for safe path manipulation

However, none of these patterns are applied to the database configuration path handling, creating an inconsistency in the security posture.

### For New Security Implementation: What Needs to Connect

Since we're implementing security fixes for database configuration, the solution must integrate with several existing systems:

**Path Validation Integration:**
The current path input system needs to be replaced with a secure validation function that:
- Resolves and normalizes paths using `pathlib.Path`
- Enforces boundaries to keep database files within the project directory
- Validates against directory traversal attacks (`../`, absolute paths outside project)
- Integrates with the existing enhanced settings manager validation framework

**SQLite Connection Security:**
The direct `sqlite3.connect()` calls need to be replaced with a context manager pattern that:
- Uses `with` statements to ensure proper connection cleanup
- Implements connection timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion
- Validates the database path before connection attempts
- Follows the same error handling patterns used in other parts of the codebase

**Settings Manager Integration:**
The database configuration updates need to properly leverage the enhanced settings manager's thread safety:
- Path validation must happen BEFORE calling `settings_manager.update_settings()`
- The validation should extend the existing `_validate_settings_update()` method
- Error messages should follow the same patterns as other validation errors

### Technical Reference Details

#### Component Interfaces & Signatures

**Current Vulnerable Functions:**
```python
# Lines 1507-1511: Unvalidated path input
database_path = st.text_input("Database File Path", value=default_path)

# Lines 1556-1568: Unsafe directory creation
db_dir = os.path.dirname(database_path)
os.makedirs(db_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Lines 1561-1585: Direct SQLite connection without context manager
conn = sqlite3.connect(database_path)
# ... operations without proper cleanup
conn.close()
```

**Required New Security Functions:**
```python
def validate_database_path(path: str, project_root: Path) -> Tuple[bool, str, Optional[Path]]:
    """Validate and normalize database path within project boundaries"""
    
def secure_sqlite_connection(db_path: Path) -> contextlib.contextmanager:
    """Context manager for secure SQLite connections with timeout"""
    
def sanitize_database_settings(settings: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Sanitize database configuration before saving"""
```

#### Data Structures

**Current Settings Structure:**
```python
updates = {
    "sqlite_db_path": database_path,  # VULNERABLE: No validation
    "sqlite_auto_backup": enable_backups,
    "sqlite_backup_retention_days": backup_retention,
    # ... other settings
}
```

**Secure Settings Structure:**
```python
updates = {
    "sqlite_db_path": validated_secure_path,  # After validation
    "sqlite_auto_backup": bool(enable_backups),
    "sqlite_backup_retention_days": int(backup_retention),
    # ... with type validation
}
```

#### Configuration Requirements

**Environment Variables:**
- Project root boundary enforcement requires `ZENITH_PROJECT_ROOT` or derive from current working directory
- SQLite timeout configuration via `SQLITE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` (default 30 seconds)

**Security Policy Requirements:**
- Database files must remain within `./data/` directory by default
- Backup files must follow the same path restrictions  
- Directory creation limited to authorized subdirectories
