- **Enterprise compliance** - Built-in support for industry standards and regulations

## Context Manifest

### How The Current Zenith Application Works: Architecture Overview

The Zenith AI document chat system is built as a modular Python application with a Streamlit-based web interface. Here's how the current system operates from initialization to user interaction:

**Application Startup Flow:**
When a user runs `python main.py ui`, the system first calls `initialize_zenith_components()` from `src/core/init_enhanced.py`. This initialization process loads configuration from `.env` files via Pydantic Settings (`src/core/config.py`), establishes logging through `src/utils/logger.py`, and initializes core components including the Qdrant vector database client, authentication manager, and AI provider connections.

The configuration system uses environment variables with fallback defaults, supporting both OpenAI and Ollama providers for chat and embeddings. Critical settings include `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `QDRANT_URL`, `QDRANT_PORT`, and authentication settings like `JWT_SECRET_KEY` and `SESSION_DURATION_HOURS`. The system defaults to local Qdrant (`localhost:6333`) and enables authentication by default.

**Authentication & User Management:**
The current authentication system (`src/auth/auth_manager.py`) uses Qdrant as both document storage and user database. When the application starts, `AuthenticationManager` ensures at least one admin user exists by creating a default admin account with auto-generated password if no administrators are found.

User data is stored in a special Qdrant collection (`zenith_users`) with each user represented as a vector point containing user metadata (username, email, password hash, role, preferences). The system supports role-based access control with `UserRole.ADMINISTRATOR` and `UserRole.USER` levels. Password hashing uses bcrypt with proper salting, and JWT tokens manage sessions with configurable expiration.

The authentication flow works as follows: user credentials are validated against stored bcrypt hashes, successful logins generate JWT tokens containing user_id, username, and role, and tokens are validated on each request. Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks, and the system tracks login attempts and failed authentications.

**Database Security & Path Validation:**
The current system includes comprehensive database security through `src/utils/database_security.py`. This module prevents path traversal attacks by validating all database file paths within project boundaries using `validate_database_path()`. The security system ensures SQLite databases can only be created in approved locations (primarily the `data/` directory) and prevents access to system directories.

Database connections use secure SQLite configurations including WAL mode for better concurrency, foreign key enforcement, secure deletion of records, and memory-based temporary storage. The `secure_sqlite_connection()` context manager ensures proper connection cleanup and timeout protection.

**AI Provider Integration:**
The `src/core/provider_manager.py` handles dynamic switching between AI providers without application restart. The system maintains separate provider instances for chat and embeddings, supporting:
- **OpenAI**: GPT models for chat, text-embedding-ada-002 for embeddings
- **Ollama**: Local models with configurable endpoints

Provider switching triggers reinitialization of dependent components through a callback system. The Enhanced Settings Manager (`src/core/enhanced_settings_manager.py`) coordinates configuration changes and notifies registered components when provider settings change.

**Vector Database Operations:**
Qdrant integration (`src/core/vector_store.py`) manages document embeddings and similarity search. The system creates collections with 1536-dimensional vectors (matching OpenAI embeddings), uses cosine similarity for document matching, and supports both local and cloud Qdrant deployments.

Document processing flows: PDFs are uploaded through Streamlit → processed by `src/core/pdf_processor.py` → chunked into smaller segments → embedded using the configured provider → stored in Qdrant collections. During chat interactions, user queries are embedded and searched against stored document vectors to retrieve relevant context.

**Chat Engine & Conversation Flow:**
The `src/core/chat_engine.py` orchestrates AI conversations using LangChain. When users ask questions, the system:
1. Embeds the query using the configured embedding provider
2. Searches Qdrant for similar document chunks
3. Constructs a prompt with retrieved context
4. Sends the prompt to the configured chat provider (OpenAI/Ollama)
5. Returns the response with source document citations

Conversation memory is managed through LangChain's memory classes, supporting both buffer and summary buffer modes. The system maintains conversation history and can reference previous exchanges within the same session.

### For New Enterprise Setup Implementation: Integration Points

Since we're implementing a comprehensive enterprise-grade setup system following the template/setup.md specification, it must integrate with and extend the current architecture at several critical points:

**Authentication System Upgrade:**
The current bcrypt-based authentication needs enhancement to support Argon2id hashing as specified in the enterprise requirements. The existing `PasswordManager` in `src/utils/security.py` provides the foundation, but we'll need to extend it with Argon2id support, password strength validation, and expiration policies. The current JWT-based session management is solid but needs enhanced security controls like multi-factor authentication support and IP restrictions.

**Database Infrastructure Evolution:**
While the current system uses Qdrant for user storage, the enterprise specification requires proper SQLite with comprehensive schemas. We need to implement a migration system that moves from Qdrant-based user storage to the specified SQLite schema with tables for users, chat_history, and roles. The existing `database_security.py` provides excellent path validation and secure connection patterns that should be leveraged and extended.

**Configuration Management Transformation:**
The current `.env`-based configuration through `src/core/config.py` needs transformation into a dynamic, enterprise-grade system. The existing Enhanced Settings Manager provides real-time configuration updates, but we need to add secure secret management, configuration versioning, and admin interfaces for runtime configuration changes.

**Secrets Management Integration:**
Currently, sensitive values like `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY` are stored in `.env` files. The enterprise system requires integration with HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or similar systems. We need to create an abstraction layer that can retrieve secrets from multiple backends while maintaining backward compatibility with `.env` files for development.

**AI Provider Enhancement:**
The existing `ProviderManager` provides excellent hot-swapping capabilities that align well with enterprise requirements. We need to extend it with health monitoring, rate limiting, cost tracking, and provider failover mechanisms. The current provider abstraction is solid and can be enhanced rather than replaced.

**Vector Database Production Readiness:**
The current Qdrant integration supports both local and cloud deployments, but enterprise requirements need enhanced cluster configuration, replication settings, backup strategies, and performance tuning. The existing `VectorStore` class provides good foundations for these enhancements.

**Reset & Deployment Workflows:**
The current `reset_database.py` and `setup.py` provide basic reset capabilities, but enterprise requirements need comprehensive deployment pipelines with backup creation, migration execution, rollback capabilities, and automated testing. The existing patterns can be extended into full deployment automation.
