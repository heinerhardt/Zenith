# Zenith PDF Chatbot - Task Completion Checklist

## When a Development Task is Completed

### 1. Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Format code with Black
black src/ --line-length 88
black . --check  # Verify formatting

# Run linting with Flake8
flake8 src/ --max-line-length=88

# Check for common issues
python -m py_compile src/**/*.py  # Syntax check
```

### 2. Testing
```bash
# Run test suite
python main.py test

# Or run pytest directly
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Test specific components if applicable
pytest tests/test_specific_module.py -v
```

### 3. Configuration Validation
```bash
# Validate system configuration
python main.py info

# Check environment setup
python main.py setup
```

### 4. System Health Checks
```bash
# Test Qdrant connection
curl http://localhost:6333/health

# Verify application components
python main.py info  # Shows component status

# Check Docker services (if using Docker)
docker ps
docker logs zenith-qdrant
```

### 5. Integration Testing
```bash
# Start the application
python main.py ui

# Test core functionality:
# - User authentication (if enabled)
# - PDF upload and processing
# - Chat functionality
# - Vector search accuracy
# - Response quality
```

### 6. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update README.md if functionality changes
- [ ] Update docstrings for modified functions
- [ ] Update type hints for any new parameters
- [ ] Add comments for complex logic
- [ ] Update configuration examples if new settings added

### 7. Environment Cleanup
```bash
# Clean temporary files
# (handled automatically by application)

# Verify no sensitive data in logs
# Check logs/zenith.log for any exposed credentials

# Clear any test data if necessary
# Remove test PDF files if added during testing
```

### 8. Performance Validation
- [ ] Check memory usage during operation
- [ ] Verify response times are acceptable
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent users (if applicable)
- [ ] Monitor CPU usage during document processing

### 9. Security Review
- [ ] No API keys or passwords in code
- [ ] Proper input validation implemented
- [ ] File upload restrictions working
- [ ] Authentication working properly
- [ ] Session management secure

### 10. Dependency Management
```bash
# Update requirements.txt if new packages added
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Verify all dependencies are properly listed
pip install -r requirements.txt --dry-run
```

### 11. Version Control
```bash
# Commit changes with descriptive message
git add .
git status  # Review changes
git commit -m "Feature: [Brief description of what was implemented]"

# Tag release if this is a significant update
git tag -a v1.x.x -m "Release version 1.x.x"
```

### 12. Deployment Verification (if deploying)
```bash
# Test Docker build
docker-compose build

# Test Docker deployment
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps  # Verify all services running

# Test production configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### 13. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Verify Langfuse integration working (if enabled)
- [ ] Check application logs for errors
- [ ] Ensure metrics collection working
- [ ] Test alerts and notifications (if configured)

### 14. User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Test with realistic PDF documents
- [ ] Verify chat responses are accurate
- [ ] Test edge cases (large files, special characters)
- [ ] Validate user workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery

### 15. Final Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Changes committed to version control
- [ ] Deployment tested (if applicable)
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] User acceptance criteria met

## Emergency Rollback Procedure
If issues are discovered after deployment:

```bash
# Stop current services
docker-compose down

# Revert to previous version
git log --oneline  # Find previous commit
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d

# Verify system is working
python main.py info
```

## Post-Completion Documentation
1. Update project changelog/release notes
2. Document any configuration changes needed
3. Update user guides if UI changes made
4. Notify team of new features or breaking changes
5. Schedule code review if working in a team environment
